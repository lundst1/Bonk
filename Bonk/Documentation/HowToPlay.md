# How to play
Bonk is a gladiator management simulator. Create gladiators and have them fight one another.

## Create a gladiator
To create a new gladiator, click the button create. A new window will open. From here you can fill out a name, select a class and set ability scores. 

You have a total of 20 ability score points that you can distribute to your gladiator. Remember that a warrior needs to be strong, a rouge agile and a mage intelligent. All classes need a good dose of constitution.

When you are done, press save and you will return to the main window.

## Start a fight
When you have created at least two gladiators you can have them fight. Select a gladiator for a fight by clicking on a gladiator in the list and then on **Select gladiator 1** or **Select gladiator 2**. Select another gladiator as opponent by selecting it in the list and then pressing which ever select button you haven't clicked yet. Remember, a gladiator cannot fight itself.

Bonk does not concern itself with controlling the gladiators. They will have a fight on their own, and the fight will end when one of them faints. Clear the arena by clicking **Clear**. From here you can set up a new fight.

## Saving and loading data
You can save and load data to json-files. Save your gladiators by clicking **File** and then **Save** or **Save as**. A window when you can name and place your file will open. Please select the extension .json. If you don't, Bonk will do it for you.

Load your data by clicking **File**, then **Open** and then selecting the file. 

## Try the demo data
Under Demo you will find a file with two gladiators. Use them if you want.
